# Flowtime

Get what motivates you done, without loosing concentration.

## Why?

The Pomodoro technique is efficient for tasks you find boring, but having to take a break when you are 100% concentrated in something you like might be annoying. That's why the Flowtime technique exists: take appropiate breaks without loosing you **flow**.

## How does it work?

The time you worked is divided by 5, and that's the break time you'll take. E.g, if you worked for 50 minutes, you'll take a 10 minute break, if you worked for 2 hours, you'll take a 24 minute break.
